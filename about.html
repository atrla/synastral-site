        Hi! I'm Lana - the creator of SYN/ASTRAL. I've studied Modern and Hellenistic astrology for 3+ years and focus on astrology as a tool that helps you explore your potential, transforming into the best version of yourself.
      <br>
      <i>By day, I'm a web & graphic designer.</i>
      <br>
      Here’s a bit about my practice:
<br>
- I primarily interpret with Modern astrology and then cross-reference that with Traditional (Hellenistic) astrology.
<br>
- I use both the Placidus and Whole House systems. I use these to triangulate interpretations instead of strictly sticking to one system (and because Whole Sign tends to work better with Traditional astrology).
<br>
- I look at decans, rulerships, and degrees.
<br>
- My specific areas of interest are Transit (predictive) astrology as well as Personal astrology. I focus on astrology as a tool that helps you explore your potential, and transform into the best version of yourself.
